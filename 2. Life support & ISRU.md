# 2) Life support & ISRU — an AGI-operated, closed-loop infrastructure (people-free first colony, human-ready by design)

**Planning premise:** the first build-out (2036 window) lands an entirely robotic/AGI workforce. Their job is to (1) locate and extract water, (2) make, store, and quality-assure oxygen and methane, (3) accumulate buffer gases (N₂/Ar) and stabilize a breathable mix for later crews, and (4) commission utilities (thermal control, pressure management, contamination control) that can run for years without humans.

---

## A. Site selection & resource verification (Year 0–1 on Mars)

1. **Shallow ice targeting.** Precursor orbiters/landers and the first cargo ships carry an AGI “prospector stack” that fuses ground-penetrating radar, neutron spectrometers, and thermal imagery with NASA’s **SWIM** maps to pick pads near **≤1 m-deep** ice in the mid-latitudes (tradeoff between thermal environment, power yield, and comms geometry). ([Jet Propulsion Laboratory][1], [NASA Science][2])

2. **Atmosphere baselining.** Local weather stations validate composition and pressure (≈**95% CO₂**, \~**2.6–2.7% N₂**, **\~1.6–1.9% Ar**), feeding atmospheric capture set-points and compressor sizing. ([NASA][3], [Space][4])

3. **AGI prospection loop.** A self-updating digital twin uses SWIM priors + in-situ drills to predict water yield vs. depth, routing excavators or **Rodwell** skids to the best ice lenses; it continuously replans if voids/rocks or brines are detected. (NASA’s Rodwell Mars experiments demonstrate feasibility; Honeybee/RedWater concepts mature thermal-drilling to liquid-well operations.) ([NASA Technical Reports Server][5], [Space][6], [ResearchGate][7])

---

## B. Water acquisition, purification & storage

**Primary mode (ice-rich sites):** **Rodwell** modules melt a cavity in buried ice and pump liquid to the surface where it’s degassed, filtered, UV-sterilized, and split between (i) potable/industrial water, (ii) electrolysis feed, and (iii) thermal mass/radiation shields. NASA modeling targeted on the order of **\~100 gal/day (≈0.38 m³/day)** per compact well in early Mars tests; our first wave deploys **4–8** wells to get to **1.5–3 m³/day** and scale from there. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][8])

**Fallback modes (if no accessible ice):**

* **Microwave extraction** from hydrated regolith; **auger-dryer/open-air** heated beds with vapor capture—breadboarded by NASA with process parameters ready for scale-out. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][9])

**Storage & quality control:** insulated, shaded tanks with vapor-recovery and inline sensors; AGI schedules periodic pasteurization cycles and monitors biofouling risk.

---

## C. Oxygen production (atmosphere → O₂) and spec

**Flight-proven basis:** **MOXIE** (solid-oxide electrolysis) on Perseverance produced **122 g total O₂**, peaking at **\~12 g/h** at **≥98% purity**, validating operation in the real Martian environment. Scale-up analyses target **\~2–3 kg/h** per unit with **\~12 kW** class power for a production-plant version. ([NASA][10], [Jet Propulsion Laboratory][11], [Science][12], [PMC][13], [ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov][14])

**AGI plant design (2036–2038):**

* **Front-end:** dust-tolerant multi-stage compressors to \~1 bar from \~6–8 mbar ambient; desiccant drying and CO₂ polishing. ([ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov][14])
* **Core:** modular SOXE stacks; hot-swap skids; predictive maintenance on cells/seals based on impedance spectra and thermal signatures. ([PMC][13])
* **Outputs & uses:**

  * **O₂** to cryo-liquefiers for oxidizer stockpiles and future life support.
  * **CO** byproduct routed to fuel synthesis (RWGS/Sabatier) or stored for CO-based tools. ([PMC][13])

**Stretch line (2038+):** **Plasma-membrane ISRU** for direct CO₂ splitting and **nitrogen fixation** chemistry (fertilizer precursors) to supplement SOXE at higher energy efficiency regimes—AGI tunes which pathway runs based on power surplus and seasonal demand. ([AIP Publishing][15], [ScienceDirect][16])

---

## D. Methane (CH₄) fuel & oxygen: end-to-end propellant loop

**Architecture:** **Sabatier** reactors (CO₂ + H₂ → CH₄ + H₂O) coupled to water electrolysis + liquefaction; this is the canonical Mars propellant chain for methane/oxygen Starships and ascent vehicles. Studies show the loop tends to be **oxygen-rich** vs. engine mixture ratio, so **CH₄ throughput** usually sets plant size. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][17])

**Hydrogen source:** from **water electrolysis** (Rodwell water preferred); AGI dynamically balances electrolysis vs. water reserves and can scavenge H₂ from Sabatier condensate to minimize imports. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][18])

**AGI control:** catalyst health monitoring (pressure-drop, conversion efficiency), deactivation prediction, and auto-recovery (temperature/flow sweeps) lengthen Sabatier life in dusty, diurnal environments. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][19])

---

## E. Buffer gases & breathable mix (for later crews)

**Acquisition:** capture/condense Mars air, remove/solidify CO₂, then separate **N₂/Ar** via **temperature- or pressure-swing adsorption**; this was studied specifically for Mars atmosphere capture and gas separation. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][20], [LPI][21])

**Why stockpile early:** life-support studies long noted that **buffer gas** supply is a gap vs. O₂ and water; banked N₂/Ar lets you run Earth-like mixes and safer partial pressures when humans arrive. ([PubMed][22])

**AGI blending:** closed-loop gas analyzers + leak localization (acoustic/pressure tomography) maintain target ppO₂ and inert balance in test habitats without people, proving long-term stability.

---

## F. Water/ECLSS integration & hygiene (robot-first)

* **Electrolysis + O₂/CH₄ liquefiers:** cold-energy cascading (use cryo boil-off to pre-cool PSA beds/compressors).
* **Potable/industrial loops:** reverse osmosis + UV + TOC monitoring; AGI schedules filter swaps by predictive fouling models.
* **Microbial stewardship:** run **bioreactors** (nitrifiers, denitrifiers) for fertilizer trials—but all within contained bays to avoid surface contamination until planetary-protection gates open.

References for extraction tech show multiple workable pathways (microwave, open-air heated beds, Rodwell); AGI chooses per-site option by yield and power economics. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][9])

---

## G. Production targets & power envelopes (first 3 Mars years)

* **Year 1 (2036–2037):**

  * Water: **\~1.5–3 m³/day** (4–8 Rodwells @ \~0.38 m³/day each as validated modeling targets). ([NASA Technical Reports Server][8])
  * O₂: **\~2 kg/h** (one scaled SOXE skid) → **\~17 t/year**; purity ≥98%. ([Science][12])
  * CH₄: sized to match \~**4:1 O₂\:CH₄** production tendency; plant throttles to fill methane tanks first. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][18])
  * Buffer gases: begin **N₂/Ar** capture to bank **hundreds of kg** over the first synodic.

* **Year 2–3 (2038–2040):** duplicate lines to **\~4–6 kg/h O₂** and **multi-m³/day water**, add plasma-membrane lines for **CO₂→O₂/CO** and **N₂ fixation** pilots. ([AIP Publishing][15], [ScienceDirect][23])

**Power notes:** SOXE scale-up studies indicate **\~12 kW** per \~**2 kg/h** O₂ module (ex-MOXIE extrapolation); Sabatier/electrolyzers add tens of kW at colony scale—budgeted in the Power Systems section. ([ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov][14])

---

## H. Autonomy & AGI advantages (why this works without people)

1. **End-to-end supervisory control.** An **AGI Mission Orchestrator** runs water mining, gas capture, electrolysis, Sabatier, liquefaction, and cryo storage as a single plant, optimizing energy, thermal budgets, and wear.
2. **Fault prediction & self-repair.** Multimodal sensors + generative diagnostics schedule hot-swaps of SOXE stacks, compressor seals, pumps, and filters before failure—a must under light-time delays and solar conjunction blackouts. (The comms constraints drive autonomy.) ([NASA][3])
3. **Adaptive chemistry.** When power is plentiful (midday, clear skies), AGI shifts to **plasma ISRU** to make oxygen/fertilizer precursors; during dust storms, it downshifts to minimal SOXE keep-alive plus water stockpiling. ([AIP Publishing][15], [ScienceDirect][23])
4. **Inventory certainty.** Continuous mass-balance audit trails for **O₂/CH₄/N₂/Ar/H₂O** give a clear “green light” for later crewed missions.

---

## I. Risk register & mitigations (ISRU/ECLSS)

* **Ice heterogeneity or cemented layers:** multi-well portfolio; Robotic overburden removal; switch to microwave/hydrated-mineral modes if wells underperform. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][9])
* **Sabatier catalyst decay:** AGI-scheduled regenerations and spare-bed rotation based on NASA durability test learnings. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][19])
* **SOXE stack degradation:** stack-level health metrics; temperature management; rapid module swaps as a line-replaceable unit. ([PMC][13])
* **Buffer-gas shortfalls:** expand PSA/TSA capacity; trade Argon-richer mixes for early habitats if needed (argon is abundant after CO₂ removal). ([NASA Technical Reports Server][20])
* **Planetary protection & biofouling:** sealed process spaces, HEPA/UV barriers, validated sterilization cycles before any external venting.

---

### What’s proven vs. what’s new

* **Proven in Mars environment:** **MOXIE** oxygen generation; **atmospheric composition**; **global shallow-ice mapping (SWIM)**. ([NASA][10], [Jet Propulsion Laboratory][1])
* **Matured terrestrially & lab-tested for Mars:** **Rodwell** extraction, **microwave/auger/open-air** water release, **Sabatier** propellant loops, **PSA/TSA** gas separations. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][24])
* **Emerging efficiency plays:** **non-thermal plasma + membranes** for CO₂ splitting and **N-fixation**—promising for AGI-controlled energy arbitrage. ([AIP Publishing][15], [ScienceDirect][23])

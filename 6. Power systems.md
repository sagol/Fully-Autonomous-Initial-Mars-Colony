# 6) Power systems — AGI-orchestrated hybrid of solar, fission, and multi-path storage (designed for a people-free colony, human-ready later)

**Guiding constraints:** (i) the first wave is uncrewed and must run for years with no field techs; (ii) global dust storms and seasonal swings make solar alone fragile; (iii) ISRU plants, construction printers, and comms need steady baseload; (iv) power must scale cleanly from \~tens of kW (2036) to hundreds of kW+ (2038–2040). NASA’s recent architecture decisions baseline **surface fission** for initial human Mars missions; we adopt the same principle for an **AGI-run robotic base**, then layer optimized solar and storage on top. ([NASA][1])

---

## A) Baseline generation mix

### 1) Fission (primary baseload from day one)

* **Technology choice:** 40-kWe-class **Fission Surface Power (FSP)** units derived from NASA’s Kilopower/KRUSTY lineage; modular, truckable on a Starship pallet, and designed for load-following and unattended operation. NASA/DOE’s program targets a lunar demo in the early 2030s and explicitly positions fission as the primary surface power for Mars. We plan **two 40-kWe units** in 2036 (N+1 at 80 kWe total), expanding to **120–160 kWe** by 2038–2040. ([NASA][2], [NASA Technical Reports Server][3])
* **Why confidence is justified:** KRUSTY ran a **full-scale nuclear ground test** in 2018 and demonstrated **stable startup, steady state, transients, and load-following**—exactly the behaviors an AGI plant manager needs to arbitrage loads and storage. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][4])
* **Program evidence & vendors:** NASA/DOE placed Phase-1 design awards with **Lockheed+BWXT**, **Westinghouse**, and **IX (Intuitive Machines + X-energy)**; contracts have since been extended and advanced toward flight hardware. ([American Nuclear Society][5], [NucNet][6])

### 2) Solar (high-throughput daytime production, sized for fair-weather & storage charging)

* **Insolation reality:** Mean top-of-atmosphere irradiance at Mars is **\~586 W/m² (\~43% of Earth’s 1,361 W/m²)**; dust and seasonality push surface yield lower, so fixed arrays alone cannot guarantee uptime. ([NSSDC][7])
* **Dust risk is not hypothetical:** **Opportunity** died in the 2018 planet-encircling storm; **InSight**’s output slid and the lander was retired in 2022 due to dust accumulation. Our design treats long, low-sunlight intervals as **design points**, not outliers. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][8], [AGU Publications][9], [NASA][10])
* **Mitigations we actually implement:**

  * **Electrostatic dust removal (EDS/EDL):** lab and field results show **>95%** clearing when dust contacts the device surface; newer electrostatic-induction methods (waterless) avoid abrasion. We outfit panels with **embedded EDS electrodes** and **edge shakers** that AGI cycles proactively based on soiling sensors. ([ScienceDirect][11], [Science][12])
  * **Panel housekeeping playbook:** timed tilts, anti-static coatings, and **acoustic/Chladni-pattern** agitation on rigid sections; AGI schedules these when array power is surplus. ([Nature][13])
* **Sizing (2036 landing):** **\~300–400 kWdc** nameplate (flex+rigid mix) spread across bermed pads and elevated frames to (i) run daytime construction/ISRU surges without cycling fission, and (ii) fast-charge storage. (Exact sizing tunes to site latitude and storm climatology; see storage strategy below.) Baseline reason: architecture studies for permanent colonies favor **hybrid plants** where solar fills the margins and charges storage whenever dust optical depth allows. ([Science Progress Journal][14], [Welcome to DTU Research Database][15])

---

## B) Storage: three complementary paths (AGI arbitrages them)

### 1) **Regenerative Fuel Cells (RFCs)** — H₂/O₂ as a rechargeable “battery”

* **Concept:** run electrolyzers on surplus power to split water into H₂ and O₂; later, recombine in fuel cells for electricity and heat. NASA Glenn’s studies sized RFCs specifically for **lunar & Martian surface** duty; RFCs excel at **multi-day** storage where batteries get mass-heavy. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][16])
* **Why we want them on Mars:** We already **make water** (Rodwells) and **handle O₂/H₂** for ISRU—so RFCs plug neatly into our utilities. NASA continues maturing RFC stacks and balance-of-plant for surface use. We stage **\~2–4 MWh** RFC storage by 2036 and expand to **\~10+ MWh** by 2038–2040. ([NASA][17], [hydrogen.energy.gov][18])

### 2) **Power-to-Methane (PtM)** — use Sabatier/LOXCH₄ as long-duration seasonal storage

* **Concept:** use excess solar/fission to drive electrolysis and **Sabatier** methanation (CO₂ + H₂ → CH₄ + H₂O), then store **LOX/LCH₄** as a dense energy buffer; reconvert back to electricity via **SOFC/PEM fuel cells** or small gensets during long dust events. Thermo-economic studies benchmark SOEC/PEM routes and integrated Sabatier stacks. ([Spiral][19], [IDEAS/RePEc][20])
* **Why Mars loves this:** the **same plant** also makes **return propellant for Starships**, so energy storage growth piggybacks on a mission-critical ISRU line—no “dead weight” assets. ([Wikipedia][21])

### 3) **Short-cycle batteries & thermal**

* **Batteries:** Li-ion/LFP racks for **minutes-to-hours** smoothing, brownout ride-through, and robotics peaks (cranes, printers).
* **Thermal storage:** dump-load of solar/fission to **sensible heat beds** and **phase-change modules** near greenhouses/ISRU; AGI manages heat-recovery loops to cut electric loads (especially during cold nights). *(These are standard engineering blocks; we prioritize RFC + PtM for true multi-day autonomy.)*

**AGI’s role:** decide—in real time—which store to charge/discharge: **batteries for transients**, **RFCs for multi-day**, **LOX/CH₄** for “**global storm** mode” or seasonal arbitrage. AGI also co-optimizes **electricity + process heat** (fuel cells’ waste heat preheats Sabatier/greenhouses). ([Science Progress Journal][14])

---

## C) Power distribution and resilience

* **Ringed microgrid:** Two **independent DC buses** (e.g., 300–600 VDC for arrays/storage, 120 VDC user bus per FSP ref), cross-tied via AGI-controlled converters. Critical loads (reactors’ pumps/valves, comms, habitat keep-alive) sit behind **solid-state switchgear** and **priority shedding**. (Voltage level aligns with FSP documentation.) ([NASA Technical Reports Server][22])
* **Storm posture:** When atmospheric optical depth passes thresholds (AGI assimilates met data), the plant switches to **fission-dominant** mode, idles nonessential loads, and relies on **RFC + LOX/CH₄** to preserve construction cadence. 2018’s global storm is our stress case. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][8], [AGU Publications][9])
* **Maintenance without people:** KRUSTY heritage shows **load-following** tolerance; AGI schedules **reactor down-power windows** for autonomous radiator wash, dust mitigation on arrays, and fuel-cell stack conditioning. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][23])

## D) Sizing the first three Mars years (illustrative, site-tunable)

| Epoch         | Fission (kWe) | PV nameplate (kWdc) |                                                                  Storage (usable) | Notes                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------: | ------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **2036–2037** |            80 |             300–400 |     **BATT** \~1–2 MWh; **RFC** \~2–4 MWh; **PtM** tanks sized for **multi-week** | Baseload fission covers nights & storms; solar runs printers/ISRU & charges stores. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][22], [Science Progress Journal][14]) |
| **2038–2039** |           120 |             600–800 |       **BATT** \~3–4 MWh; **RFC** \~6–8 MWh; **PtM** scaled with propellant plant | Redundant reactor + larger arrays; AGI starts seasonal arbitrage. ([NASA][2])                                                                             |
| **2040**      |          160+ |              1,000+ | **BATT** \~5 MWh; **RFC** ≥10 MWh; **PtM** sized for **dust-season ride-through** | Plant supports full construction & life-support dress-rehearsal. ([Science Progress Journal][14])                                                         |

*(Numbers reflect current public FSP module ratings, Mars insolation, and hybrid-system studies; exact values will be re-solved by the AGI scheduler with real site telemetry.)* ([NASA Technical Reports Server][22], [NSSDC][7], [Science Progress Journal][14])

---

## E) Why this mix is robust (lessons from Mars missions)

* **Solar alone is brittle** under dust loading and seasonal low sun: **InSight** degraded to retirement; **Opportunity** did not survive the 2018 storm. Design must assume **weeks** of low-generation. ([NASA][10], [NASA Technical Reports Server][8])
* **Fission is weather-independent** and already baselined by NASA for Mars—our AGI uses it as the anchor while solar opportunistically fills storage. ([NASA][1])
* **Storage matters as much as generation:** NASA’s own surface studies emphasize **Regenerative Fuel Cells** for multi-day energy; **power-to-methane** provides the **seasonal** buffer and doubles as ascent propellant. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][16], [Spiral][19])

---

## F) Concrete AGI work packages (power)

1. **Grid Orchestrator:** MPC controller that co-optimizes fission set-points, PV MPPT, RFC/PtM charging, and load schedules (printers, ISRU, comms, heating). Inputs include dust forecasts and array soiling models derived from **InSight/Opportunity** climatology. ([NASA][24], [NASA Technical Reports Server][8])
2. **Array Hygiene:** Policy engine for **electrostatic/induction cleaners** + tilt/shake cycles to keep soiling below thresholds, scheduled against price-of-power curve. ([ScienceDirect][11], [Science][12])
3. **Reactor Digital Twin:** Predictive maintenance and load-follow envelopes, derived from **KRUSTY** data and vendor sims; autonomous hot/cold starts and radiator health checks. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][23])
4. **Black-Sky Mode:** Pre-baked profiles for planet-encircling storms: fission at safe continuous output, all nonessential loads shed, **RFC/LOX-CH₄** discharge plan for 30–45 days. (2018 storm is the benchmark.) ([NASA Technical Reports Server][8])

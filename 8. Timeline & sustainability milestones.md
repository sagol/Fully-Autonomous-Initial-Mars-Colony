# 8) Timeline & sustainability milestones — AGI-first colony, shifted +10 years (windows: 2036 → 2048), human-ready but initially uncrewed

**Why these dates:** Classic Mars launch windows recur about **every 26 months (\~780 days)**, so buildout happens in discrete waves; NASA explains this cadence and plans missions around it. ([NASA Science][1])
**Context:** We assume Starship must master **orbital cryogenic refueling** before true cargo ferrying to Mars scales—NASA and industry describe it as a critical, non-trivial step—hence our +10-year shift from earlier 2026/2028 targets. ([Ars Technica][2], [The Wall Street Journal][3])

## Window 1 — 2036 (uncrewed “power + ISRU + pad” commissioning)

**Primary objectives**

* Land AGI-directed infrastructure ships; print/sinter **landing pad, berms, roads**; stand up **80 kWe fission** (two 40-kWe Fission Surface Power–class units). ([NASA][4], [NASA Technical Reports Server][5])
* Deploy **300–400 kWdc** PV with electrostatic dust-clearing; bring online **regenerative fuel cells** (RFC) and initial LOX/CH₄ storage as long-duration energy buffer. (Dust storms force this hybrid by design; see InSight/Opportunity experience.) ([NASA Science][6], [NASA][7], [Space][8])
* Start **water acquisition** (Rodwell/microwave) and **O₂ manufacture**; MOXIE heritage sets purity and operations envelope (**122 g total, up to 12 g/h at ≥98% purity** proved on Mars). ([NASA Science][9])
* Use **Mars Relay Network** (MRO/MAVEN/TGO/…) + **DSN** for backhaul; all assets run **DTN** with pre-loaded conjunction plans (2-week command pause when Sun blocks RF). ([NASA Science][10], [NASA][7], [Jet Propulsion Laboratory][11])

**Go/no-go criteria for scale-up**

* ≥**1.5 m³/day** water + continuous O₂ production; **30–45 days** autonomous power coverage (fission+storage) proven across a dust event; safe ops through a full **solar conjunction**. ([NASA Science][6])

---

## Window 2 — 2038 (uncrewed “hab & comms” expansion)

**Primary objectives**

* Add **MARS-COM-1** areostationary telecom (UHF proximity + Ka; optical when available) to reduce reliance on aging orbiters; continue DSN as the Earth backbone. ([NASA Science][10], [NASA][7])
* Assemble **Ice-Home–style pressurized volumes** (unoccupied) and seal them for long-term pressure-hold tests; complete **600–800 kWdc** PV; storage to **6–8 MWh RFC** plus growing LOX/CH₄ buffer. (Power mix mirrors NASA’s fission-anchored architectures.) ([NASA][4])
* Begin **hydroponic/aquaponic** modules (robot-run) to validate food-loop controls ahead of people.

**Milestones/KPIs**

* **90-day** no-contact autonomy verified (conjunction + contingency); **first propellant batches** qualified for return-vehicle class purity.

---

## Window 3 — 2040 (uncrewed “human-ready” certification gate)

**Primary objectives**

* Redundant **120–160 kWe** fission online; **≥1,000 kWdc** PV field; **≥10 MWh** RFC + **seasonal LOX/CH₄** energy reserve (PtM). ([NASA][4])
* **ECLSS dress rehearsal** inside empty habs (pressure, leak-localization, atmosphere blend with **N₂/Ar** captured from the CO₂-rich air). ([NASA Science][10])
* **Stockpiles**: target **\~30 t O₂**, **\~8–10 t CH₄**, **\~500 m³** potable+industrial water, and spare parts for 2 synods of maintenance (illustrative gate, tuned by AGI logistics).

**“Green light for crews” conditions (earliest **2038–2040**):**

1. Power N+1 across fission/solar/storage; 2) ISRU meets return-propellant spec; 3) comms blackouts fully survivable under autonomy; 4) habs hold pressure ≥12 months without human intervention. (The +10-year shift lines up with refueling maturation and DSN/MRN realities.) ([Ars Technica][2], [NASA Science][10], [Jet Propulsion Laboratory][11])

---

## Window 4 — 2042 (optional short-stay crew) / 2044 (crew rotation & scale)

**If crewed flights are cleared:**

* Fly a **short-stay** expedition (2042) or go directly to initial rotation (2044), leveraging **orbital refueling** that NASA expects to demo beforehand; multiple tanker flights per mission are anticipated. ([Ars Technica][2], [Payload][12])
* Expand **manufacturing micro-park** (molten regolith electrolysis / carbothermal O₂ + metals; sulfur-regolith concrete; basalt fibers) for local spares and structure scaling. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][5])

---

## Window 5 — 2046/2048 (industrialization & redundancy)

* Field **second telecom orbiter** (high-inclination areosynchronous) and additional storage; push toward **food ≥50% local**, **water 100% local**, **O₂/CH₄ 100% local**, and **>60% spare-parts tonnage local** (metals/ceramics/polymers).
* Site growth guided by **SWIM** shallow-ice maps; Arcadia Planitia remains a prime candidate because of near-surface ice and gentle terrain. ([NASA Science][13], [NASA][14])

## Sustainability ladder (how we measure “self-sustaining”)

> These are **mission targets**, not today’s capabilities; we tie each rung to proven or actively maturing tech.

1. **Survivability:** ride through **>30-day** dust events + 2-week solar conjunctions with no human input (achieved in uncrewed ops). ([Jet Propulsion Laboratory][11])
2. **Utilities closure:** 100% local **water** + **oxygen** (MOXIE-derived chemistry scaled), stable buffer gases harvested from air. ([NASA Science][9])
3. **Energy closure:** fission baseload + solar opportunistic, with **RFC + LOX/CH₄** covering multi-day to seasonal gaps; AGI arbitrages stores. (DSN/MRN enable ops oversight, not real-time control.) ([NASA][4], [NASA Science][10])
4. **Mass closure (early):** local bricks/tiles/SRC, simple metals via **MRE/CaRD**, basic biopolymers; **>60%** mass of replacement parts by tonnage made locally. ([NASA Technical Reports Server][5])
5. **Mass closure (mature):** local **electronics substrates & optics**; **>80%** consumables by mass produced locally; import focuses on high-precision components.
6. **Population-ready:** power, food, spares, medical, and comms scaled to human crews with N+2 redundancy; **self-sufficiency horizon 20–50 years** from first permanent crews (varies by industrial depth—Musk’s public targets are aggressive; our plan assumes a conservative ramp). ([Wikipedia][15])

## Why the +10-year slip is prudent

* **Refueling is the pacing item.** NASA/industry expect **large-scale Starship-to-Starship cryo transfer** demos before routine depots—multiple tanker launches per mission likely. That complexity justifies shifting crewed Mars attempts from **\~2028–2030** to **\~2038–2040**. ([Ars Technica][2], [Payload][12])
* **Ops reality:** **26-month** launch cadence, **2-week** conjunction blackouts, and dust-driven power dips are hard constraints that **AGI-first automation** solves before people arrive. ([NASA Science][1], [Jet Propulsion Laboratory][11])

---

## Source anchors (for this schedule logic)

* **Launch cadence & geometry:** NASA explains the **\~26-month** windows. ([NASA Science][1])
* **Solar conjunction ops pause:** NASA/JPL practice **\~2 weeks no uplink**. ([Jet Propulsion Laboratory][11])
* **MOXIE results (O₂ on Mars):** **122 g total, 98% purity**, 16 runs. ([NASA Science][9])
* **Fission surface power/KRUSTY heritage:** ground test + program path to surface systems. ([NASA][4], [NASA Technical Reports Server][5])
* **MRN & DSN backbones:** current Mars relay constellation and Earth deep-space antennas. ([NASA Science][10], [NASA][7])
* **Orbital refueling maturity as a gating item:** NASA road-map and current reporting. ([Ars Technica][2], [The Wall Street Journal][3])

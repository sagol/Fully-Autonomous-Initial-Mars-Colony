# Colony Risk Register (AGI-first Mars Outpost)

*Concise, action-oriented register of the top constraints that will govern an AGI-operated, uncrewed colony. Each row includes hard evidence, likelihood and impact, what to watch, AGI-driven preventions, contingency moves, and the residual risk you still carry.*

## Notes on ratings

* **Likelihood**: L/M/H reflect current evidence and TRL. **Impact**: 1 (local inconvenience) → 5 (mission-threatening).
* We treat **dust storms, latency/blackouts, and resource heterogeneity** as **design points**, not edge cases. ([NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory][3], [NASA][4], [ESA Blog][10])

## Cross-cutting AGI controls (apply to many risks)

* **DTN/BPv7 everywhere** with contact-graph scheduling and BPSec policies for provenance and priority. ([IETF Datatracker][21])
* **Digital twins** for reactors, PV fields, ISRU stacks; predictive maintenance to swap modules before failure (extends to ECLSS/ORUs). ([NASA Technical Reports Server][17])
* **Storm posture**: pre-charge **RFC** and **PtM** stores; lock to fission baseload; noncritical shed. (Tactics derived from Opportunity/InSight lessons.) ([NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory][3], [NASA][4])
